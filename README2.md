#primitive data types

`String` is representation of `runes`
`rune`is a fixed number of bytes which contains bits (ie 32 bits is 4bytes x 8bits)
`iteration` over string iterates over `bytes` which does not represent full `rune`
`loop` through `rune` requires special operation

``` ````
to `create a rune` should use rune literal `'`, backticks ``` for symbols


for `strings` we use double quotes `"a"`
Raw literal: `Lets code together` use when strings have single/double quotes
